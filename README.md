## Summary
Yoki is a Open-Source Discord Bot focused on the concept of "Spaces", or containers of communities residing in one Discord Server. This can be especially useful to creators who don't feel comfortable recruiting admins, making channels, editing settings, or any other aspect of a Regular Discord Server. It is built on a system of "Channel Categories" that are assigned to certain roles, and in which the Server Owner can decide how the role is added to a person (i.e. React Roles).
